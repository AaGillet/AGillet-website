The first results of the Back2Sea project are now available in our recent [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51963-w) 
published in *Nature Communications*.

Using morphological data from more than 7,500 vertebrae of 62 different species of modern cetaceans, we demonstrate that the cetacean backbone
 is still highly regionalized. However, the regionalization pattern is drastically different from the pattern traditionally found in terrestrial mammals 
pointing at a repatterning of the organization of the backbone during the land-to-water transition. We summarize this new cetacean-specific pattern in the
Nested Regions hypothesis.

Our new findings are featured on [Harvard's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology webiste](https://oeb.harvard.edu/news/whale-tail-unraveling-evolutionary-secrets-how-whales-and-dolphins-adapted-their-backbones).
and on the [Springer Nature Research Communities ](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/the-land-to-water-transition-led-to-a-repatterning-of-the-mammal-backbone-in-cetaceans)
