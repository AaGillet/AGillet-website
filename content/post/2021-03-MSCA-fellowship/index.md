I received the great news that I have been awarded a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Global Fellowship from the European Commission for the **Back2Sea** project. This project will be carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Katrina E. Jones](https://www.katrinaejones.com/) at the University of Manchester (UK) and [Prof. Stephanie E. Pierce](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/spierce/home) at Harvard University (USA). The Back2Sea project is set to start in the fall 2021 and will investigate the the impact of the secondary
invasion of the aquatic realm on the mammalian backbone. Stay tuned for more (marine) mammal vertebrae!
