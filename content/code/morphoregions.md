The code using segmented linear regressions to investigate regionalization patterns in serially 
homologous structures (such as the backbone) is available as part of the 
[<i>MorphoRegions</i>](https://aagillet.github.io/MorphoRegions/) R-package and comes with
 a detailed [tutorial](https://aagillet.github.io/MorphoRegions/articles/MorphoRegions.html).
