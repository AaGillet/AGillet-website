abstract: "Cetacean reinvasion of the aquatic realm is an iconic ecological transition 
that led to drastic modifications of the mammalian body plan, especially in the axial skeleton. 
Relative to the vertebral column of other mammals that is subdivided into numerous anatomical regions, 
regional boundaries of the cetacean backbone appear obscured. Whether the traditional 
mammalian regions are present in cetaceans but hard to detect due to anatomical homogenization 
or if regions have been entirely repatterned remains unresolved. Here we combine a segmented 
linear regression approach with spectral clustering to quantitatively investigate the number, 
position, and homology of vertebral regions across 62 species from all major cetacean clades. 
We propose the Nested Regions hypothesis under which the cetacean backbone is composed of six 
homologous modules subdivided into six to nine post-cervical regions, with the degree of regionalization
 dependent on vertebral count and ecology. Compared to terrestrial mammals, the cetacean backbone 
is less regionalized in the precaudal segment but more regionalized in the caudal segment, 
indicating repatterning of the vertebral column associated with the transition from limb-powered 
to axial-driven locomotion."
