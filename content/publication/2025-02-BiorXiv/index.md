abstract: "Pigmentation patterns are integral to animal biology and uncovering the mechanisms driving 
their diversification is essential for determining the evolutionary principles that shape this 
fundamental aspect of biodiversity. Coral reef fishes are particularly notable for their extraordinary 
pattern diversity, ranging from simple spots and stripes to intricate, maze-like designs. Despite over 
a century of investigation, the evolutionary processes that govern the diversification of these 
pigmentation patterns remain one of the most persistent unresolved questions in evolutionary biology. 
Here, we investigate the relationship between pattern diversity, species richness, and geography 
across six iconic families of pattern-diverse coral reef fishes. Utilizing time-calibrated phylogenies, 
we reveal constant disparity of pigmentation patterns across globally variable reef fish communities. 
We find strong evidence for a positive correlation between pattern diversity and species richness, 
with a high divergence of pigmentation patterns in sympatry that highlights the role of these patterns 
in speciation and phenotypic differentiation. Moreover, our findings support the stages model of adaptive 
radiation, revealing that most pigmentation pattern diversity has emerged in evolutionary history. 
These results demonstrate that the evolutionary history of pigmentation patterns in reef fishes is 
characterized by a combination of rapid and constrained phenotypic diversification that has likely 
played a crucial role in their speciation dynamics."
