#abstract: "The reinvasion of the aquatic realm by cetaceans is one of the most iconic ecological transitions 
#that led to drastic modifications of the mammalian body plan, especially the axial skeleton. Relative to the 
#vertebral column of other mammals that is subdivided into numerous anatomical regions, regional boundaries 
#of the cetacean backbone appear obscured. Whether the traditional mammalian regions are present in cetaceans 
#but hard to detect due to anatomical homogenization or if regions have been entirely repatterned remains 
#unresolved. Here we combine a segmented linear regression approach with spectral clustering to quantitatively 
#investigate the number, position, and homology of vertebral regions across species from all major cetacean 
#clades. We propose the new “Nested Regions” hypothesis under which the cetacean backbone is composed of six 
#homologous modules subdivided into six to nine post-cervical regions, with the degree of regionalization 
#dependent on vertebral count and ecology. Compared to terrestrial mammals, the cetacean backbone is less 
#regionalized in the precaudal segment but more regionalized in the caudal segment, indicating repatterning 
#of the vertebral column associated with the transition from limb-powered to axial-driven locomotion."
