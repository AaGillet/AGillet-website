I greatly value sharing my knowledge and findings with a broader audience and welcome any opportunity to do so. 
Besides disseminating research output through press releases (*see a selection of press articles below*), 
I have given informal seminars for broad audiences such as visitors of the Marine Megafauna Foundation (Tofo, Mozambique), 
high school teachers as part of the Teacher Professional Development program at Harvard Museum of Natural Hisotry, 
and visitors of the Harvard Museum of Natural History during National Fossil Day. I am also a member of [ODYSSEA](https://www.odyssea.lu/en/), a Luxembourgish association dedicated to raising awareness about marine conservation
using science communication and outreach activites.
